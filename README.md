# reSkilling
This is a personal project repository. Created mainly to learn interesting skills.

## Folders:
 - nn_implemetation = contains a script to create a NN from scratch in Python and another script to create the same NN using the Theano package
 - rnn_example = contains my first attempt to create a Recurrent Neural Network for automated text generation. 
 - ML = contains my solutions to exercises from the Machine Learning course from coursera.  
 - deeplearning.ai = contains my solutions to exercises from the series of courses with same name from coursera.

##### Discalimer:
Most of the codes are originally from other authors, I modify them for submitting HWs, to play around and to get a better insight from them.
